            <p>We believe that just because a person chooses to live in a rural area doesn't mean they should have over
                priced or slow Internet. At Nomad, we contract with the three major carrier networks to provide a
                network connection to those that live in rural communities and/or those that travel regularly. By
                combining the latest SG technology with the Provider's service, Nomad provides the advantages of a major
                internet provider without the contract. Our mission is to connect the unconnected</p>

            <p>Membership with Nomad includes up to unlimited, high-speed 5G LTE mobile hotspot data for normal internet
                usage (wherever you have a 5G LTE signal). All offers, content, promotions & prices listed today are
                subject to change without prior notice, and data limitations, speeds, and availability of service may
                vary. The amount or speed of data may be reduced by data usage. All Nomad plans are subject to Nomad's
                Terms of Service which can be found here.</p>

            <p>Nomad is not responsible for changes to the network made by the providing carrier, and has no control
                over possible network optimization changes enforced by the Provider. We also are not responsible for
                agreements that are currently in place with the Provider should they change. Network optimizations being
                conducted by the Provider such as cell tower deprioritization in congested areas is done at the
                discretion of the Provider. Available for US Residents Only</p>
